A collection of reusable tools and utilities that I found I was often
re-implementing in different Java projects.

Highlights include:

 * Common [string handling](http://evmcl.github.com/evlibjava/index.html?com/evanmclean/evlib/lang/Str.html) routines.

 * Common [string escaping](http://evmcl.github.com/evlibjava/index.html?com/evanmclean/evlib/escape/Esc.html) for HTML, URLs and others.

 * [Thread-safe JOptionPane](http://evmcl.github.com/evlibjava/index.html?com/evanmclean/evlib/swing/SafeOptionPane.html) wrapper.

 * Various [file and I/O](http://evmcl.github.com/evlibjava/index.html?com/evanmclean/evlib/io/package-summary.html) utilities.

and [plenty more](http://evmcl.github.com/evlibjava/index.html).

See the [javadoc](http://evmcl.github.com/evlibjava/index.html) for all the details.
