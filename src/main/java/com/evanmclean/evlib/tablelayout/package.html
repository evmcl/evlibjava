<p>Utilities to make it easier dealing with TableLayouts.</p>

<p>You generally use the <a
href="TableLayoutFactory.html">TableLayoutFactory</a> to create a correctly
configured <code>TableLayout</code> object, and the <a
href="TableLayoutConstraintFactory.html">TableLayoutConstraintFactory</a> to
specify the constraints for each child component.</p>

<p>e.g. For making the following form:</p>

<pre>
     +-------------------------------------+
     |        ---------------------------  |
     | File: |                           | |
     |        ---------------------------  |
     |                                     |
     |                             ------  |
     |                            | OKAY | |
     |                             ------  |
     +-------------------------------------+
</pre>

<p>The form is comprised of three columns and two rows. The code to build this
would look something like:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
TableLayout layout = TableLayoutFactory
.build(5)
.fillcols(false, true, false)
.fillrows(false, false)
.make();

TableLayoutConstraintFactory const = new TableLayoutConstraintFactory(layout);

JPanel panel = new JPanel(layout);

JLabel label = new JLabel("File:");
panel.add(label, const.build(0, 0).right().vcentre().make());

JTextField path = new JTextField();
panel.add(path, const.build(1, 0).hfull().vfull().width(2).make());

JButton okay = new JButton("Okay");
panel.add(path, const.build(2, 1).right().vfull().make());
</pre></blockquote>

<p>First we construct a table layout with vertical and horizontal gaps of 5.
The <code>fillcols</code> call takes a variable number of booleans, indicating
which columns use preferred sizing and which stretch (and specifies the number
of columns while doing so). The <code>fillrows</code> call does the same for
the rows of the table layout, and then <code>make</code> actually constructs
the layout object.</p>

<p>In this case, we wanted the middle column of the layout to be stretchy,
while the other two columns stick with the preferred size of their
components.</p>

<p>Then we create the constraint factory helper object, which we'll use when
adding components to the form.</p>

<p>We create the panel which will represent our form, giving it the table
layout object to handle its layout of components.</p>

<p>We add the label component in column 0, row 0 of the panel, telling the
layout that the component should be right justified and vertically centred.</p>

<p>We then add the text field in column 1 of the same row, but this time the
component should fill the cells both horizonally and vertically. The text field
should also fill up two cells (the width).</p>

<p>Lastly, we have the okay button, which goes on the second row (row 1) and
the last column (column 2), be right justified but fill the cell
vertically.</p>
